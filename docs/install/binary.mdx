title: Prebuilt Ghostty Binaries and Packages
description: |-
  Install Ghostty without building it manually by downloading
  and running a prebuilt binary or package.
---

The Ghostty project only officially provides prebuilt binaries
for macOS. Other platforms may provide packages for Ghostty,
but those packages are not officially maintained by the Ghostty project.
This page will list both official and community-provided binary packages.

## macOS

Official macOS binaries are provided by the Ghostty project and
are available on the [download page](/download).

These binaries are signed and notarized by the Ghostty project.
To install, download the `.dmg` file, open it, and drag the
Ghostty application to your Applications folder. This is the same
process as installing many typical macOS applications.

### Homebrew

A [Homebrew cask](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/ghostty) is available and maintained by the Ghostty community.

```sh
brew install --cask ghostty
```

## Linux

Pre-built Linux binaries or packages are provided by the community.
At the time of writing, no community-provided packages are available
because Ghostty has only recently been publicly released. This page
will be updated as community-provided packages become available.

If your platform isn't available, you must
[build Ghostty from source](/docs/install/build.mdx).

<Tip>
  **Interested in creating a package for your platform?** Check out the
  [packaging
  guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md). If you
  need any help, feel free to make an issue. Once your package is ready, submit
  a pull request to add it to this page!

### Arch Linux

The latest tagged release of Ghostty is available as
[`ghostty`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/ghostty/)
in Arch Linux's `[extra]` repository.

```sh
pacman -S ghostty
```

Additionally a recipe for building and installing the tip of the `main`
branch from source is available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) as
[ghostty-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ghostty-git).
Installation may be done with an AUR helper or from source per the
[usual AUR instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages).

```sh
# Install Ghostty tip
yay -S ghostty-git
```

<Note>
This package is maintained by Arch Linux maintainers and not the Ghostty
project.
</Note>

### Gentoo

Ghostty is available in the official Gentoo repository.

```sh
emerge -av ghostty
```

<Note>
This package is maintained by Gentoo maintainers and not the Ghostty project.

### Nix Flake

There is Nix package that can be used in the
[Ghostty flake](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/flake.nix)
(`packages.ghostty` or `packages.default`). This is a good way
to track specific commits of Ghostty.

While the Ghostty project does not maintain any official packages for
Linux, Ghostty maintains an in-repo Nix flake because Nix is used as
our primary development and CI environment. The Ghostty project does
not maintain any official NixOS packages (in `nixpkgs`).

Below is an example:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    ghostty = {
      url = "github:ghostty-org/ghostty";
    };
  };

  outputs = {
    nixpkgs,
    ghostty,
    ...
  }: {
    nixosConfigurations.mysystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            ghostty.packages.x86_64-linux.default
          ];
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Void Linux

Ghostty is available in the official package repository.

```sh
xbps-install ghostty
```

<Note>
This package is maintained by Void Linux maintainers and not the Ghostty project.
